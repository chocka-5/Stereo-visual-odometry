# Stereo-visual-odometry
### Determine 6-D pose of the camera by using stereo image sequences using datasets from KITTI
##### Determine static features using FAST algorithm
##### Feature matching and tracking using LK optical flow 
##### Optimize using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares minimization to get the rotation and translation matrix (6D pose of the vehicle)
